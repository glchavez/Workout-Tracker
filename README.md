# Workout-Tracker

## Description

This application allows users to track their exercise stats and view a weekly overview of their workouts.

This application is intended to help individuals track their workouts for personal goals, such as stength gaining, weight loss, or general motivation.

Main challenges faced when creating this application was creating routes that returned the sum of workout duration and weight lifted. For future improvements, i would like to create a share function, which you can compare workouts to friends for additional challanges/motivation.

## Usage

As a user, you will start on the homepage that contains your last workout information and the ability to continue your workout or create a new one. If you would like to add a new exercise to the existing workout, click the "continue workout" button. To create a new workout, click on the "new workout" button.

The new workout button will take you to a page that has stat fields you can fill out. First select from the dropdown menu if the workout is resistance or cardio. This selection will populate additional fields that pertain to the type of workout. Once all fields are filled out, you can add the exercise to your workout.

To view a weekly overview of your workouts, you can click on the "dashbaord" option in the navbar. This dashboard will show a graph of your weekly workout durations, a graph of your weekly weight lifted, and two pie diagrams of your workout type information.
